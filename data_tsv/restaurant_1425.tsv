1425	Don Geppi	corso Marion Crawford 40	 Sant' Agnello	 80065	 Italy	€€€€	Creative	There are just five tables at this restaurant in the Majestic Palace Hotel, where the plant-themed decor on the walls echoes the romantic views through the window of one of the most beautiful gardens on the coast. Here, citrus and olive trees (including a thousand-year-old olive tree) are planted alongside a kitchen garden where many of the vegetables used in the dishes served here are grown. Chef Mario Affinita delights guests with his three tasting menus inspired by the region of Campania and his experience abroad. The end result is elaborate, technical and precise cuisine that is more than equal to the superb setting in which it is served.
