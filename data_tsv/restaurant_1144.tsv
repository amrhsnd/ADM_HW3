1144	Enotavola	via dell'Arco 37	 Padua	 35122	 Italy	€€	Seafood	The entrance to this restaurant through a wine-bar can be misleading, as you are eventually led to simpler – yet still attractive – dining rooms. In this wine-themed setting, enjoy delicious fish and seafood dishes with the occasional creative twist, accompanied by a particularly extensive selection of wines by the glass. A highly recommended address for fish lovers, situated right in the historic centre of Padova.
