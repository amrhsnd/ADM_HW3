The most atmospheric tables are those by the canal, while the dishes themselves combine regional influence with a touch of fantasy. In addition to the à la carte, guests can choose from two tasting menus: the more creative Ti P'Orto al Mareand the Essenziale, perfect for anyone tasting this style of cuisine for the first time. Traditionalists will be pleased to hear that the famous tiramisù is still on the menu!
