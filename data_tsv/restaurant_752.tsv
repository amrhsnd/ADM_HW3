752	Locanda del Capitano & Tipico Osteria	via Roma 7	 Montone	 06014	 Italy	€€	Umbrian, Traditional Cuisine	The Locanda del Capitano and the Tipico offer menus showcasing traditional Umbrian dishes (the former serves gourmet cuisine, while the latter offers a simpler menu). The wine list boasts over 400 labels, while the olive oil selection includes the best oils from the region. Our inspector particularly enjoyed the “maritozzo di mazzafegato” (a type of sausage bun) with escarole, caramelised onions and olives.
