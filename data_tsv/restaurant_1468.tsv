1468	Il Grano di Pepe	via Roma 178/a	 Ravarino	 41017	 Italy	€€€	Seafood, Mediterranean Cuisine	While you’re trying to decide between the tasting menu and the à la carte at this restaurant, you can tuck into its excellent bread, including the “sfincione” – a type of tomato-flavoured focaccia from Palermo which makes the journey here worthwhile on its own! If fish is your preference, we recommend the “Palermo and Marseille” fish stew, an intense dish full of bold and delicious flavours. Minimalist decor and a friendly welcome from chef Rino Duca complete the picture.	['Mastercard', 'Visa']	['Air conditioning', 'Wheelchair access']	+39 391 317 2377	https://ilgranodipepe.it/
