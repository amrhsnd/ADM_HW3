175	Osteria dai Mazzeri	via Pallade 18	 Follina	 31051	 Italy	€€	Venetian, Traditional Cuisine	Once the town hall of Follina, this building dating from 1704 is now home to a restaurant run by two brothers who serve delicious regional and seasonal cuisine here (in winter, don’t miss the spit-roasted chicken, veal or pork cooked according to local tradition). A beautiful mulberry tree, the old symbol of the village that was once involved in the silk industry, graces the outdoor dining space.
