1279	Su Gologone	Località Su Gologone	 Oliena	 08025	 Italy	€€	Sardinian, Traditional Cuisine	It is difficult to choose between the three delightful rooms in this restaurant. One has a huge fireplace used for roasting the famous porceddu (suckling pig); another, more intimate in style, is dedicated to a well-known ceramist; while the third is adorned with works by a Sardinian artist. Whichever you choose, you’ll enjoy traditional cuisine from inland Sardinia with the option of dining on a panoramic terrace overlooking vineyards and olive groves in fine weather. House specialities include suckling pig roasted on the spit, maccarones de busa (pasta), and culurgiones (a type of ravioli).
