239	Antica Trattoria da Miculan	piazza Libertà 16	Tricesimo	33019	Italy	€	Regional Cuisine	A small bar busy with locals acts as a sort of “antechamber” to this typical trattoria with a summer terrace on Tricesimo’s main square. The restaurant, which boasts traditional regional features, such as the wood-burning stove known as a fogher, serves local specialities alongside a few fish dishes. In summer, there’s a tasting menu which focuses exclusively on fish.	['Dinersclub', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	['Air conditioning', 'Terrace']	+39 0432 851504	https://www.trattoriamiculan.com/
