1667	Essentia	piazza San Nicolò 2	Castrocaro Terme	47011	Italy	€€	Country cooking, Modern Cuisine	Situated at the foot of the fortress in the historic centre of Castrocaro, this restaurant has an interesting young chef at the helm, Andrea Giacchini. The cuisine often (but not always) has a local influence and demonstrates remarkable technical expertise that is neither overly ostentatious nor an end in itself, but rather a way of skilfully showcasing the top-quality ingredients used.
