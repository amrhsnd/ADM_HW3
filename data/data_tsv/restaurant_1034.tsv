1034	Osteria alle Testiere	calle del Mondo Novo, sestiere  Castello 5801	Venice	30122	Italy	€€€	Venetian, Modern Cuisine	This restaurant, now one of the most popular bistros in Venice, started out as a typical Venetian “bacaro”. The cuisine focuses on traditional Mediterranean and Venetian dishes, including vegetables, many of which are grown in a kitchen garden on Sant'Erasmo island (Osti in Orto) – an initiative which sees a number of small restaurants coming together to grow and share produce. The menu changes in line with market availability. With just a few tables, booking well in advance is highly recommended.
