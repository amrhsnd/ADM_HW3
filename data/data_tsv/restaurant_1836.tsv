1836	Namo Ristobottega	via Giovan Battista Marzi 1	Tarquinia	01016	Italy	€€	Seasonal Cuisine, Farm to table	This simple, tiny restaurant stands just outside the walls of Tarquinia, barely a kilometre from the splendid necropolis of Monterozzi (UNESCO World Heritage Site). The female owner-chef pays tribute to the Viterbo region with her imaginative use of seasonal ingredients in light dishes which are full of flavour, while the à la carte demonstrates a wide use of vegetables. The outdoor space offers views extending as far as the coast.	['Amex', 'Dinersclub', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	['Air conditioning', 'Terrace']	+39 0766 731637	http://www.namoristobottega.it
