1429	La Corte Gourmet	piazza Angelo Borroni 1	Lainate	20045	Italy	€€€	Italian, Modern Cuisine	An interesting choice of wine with plenty of options by the glass, attentive service in a classic yet contemporary-style dining room, and good, honest cuisine prepared by owner-chef Paolo. The seasonal menu features classic favourites such as Fassona beef tartare and breaded veal cutlets cooked in butter alongside imaginative pasta dishes and truffles (in season). Guests have the option of dining in the attractive “champagneria”, surrounded by exposed brickwork and bottles that have been carefully selected by Antonella, the life and soul of the restaurant.
