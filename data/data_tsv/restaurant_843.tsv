843	Antica Locanda del Villoresi	via Sempione 4	Nerviano	20014	Italy	€€	Mediterranean Cuisine	What was once a post station is now a renowned restaurant overlooking the Villoresi canal. Although the attractive dining room has retained some of its historical features, the decor here is more contemporary in feel. The Mediterranean-style cuisine focuses mainly on fish and is beautifully presented, with dishes such as fried artichokes with red prawns and bottarga on the menu in season. Raw fish dishes are also occasionally available.	['Amex', 'Maestrocard', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	['Air conditioning', 'Car park', 'Terrace']	+39 0331 559450
