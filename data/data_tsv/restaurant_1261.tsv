1261	Abraxas Osteria	via Scalandrone 15, località Lucrino	 Pozzuoli	 80078	 Italy	€€	Campanian	Situated inland at a slightly higher altitude than the coast, this restaurant on two floors focuses all its attention on its regional cuisine and its wine list. Very good value for money, although you will spend a bit more (and it’s worth it! ) if you choose one of the grilled meat options.
