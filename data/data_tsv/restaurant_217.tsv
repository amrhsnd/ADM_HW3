217	Osteria da Afro	via Umberto I 14	Spilimbergo	33097	Italy	€€	Regional Cuisine, Country cooking	An expertly run family restaurant not far from the historic centre. Warm atmosphere in the two dining rooms (especially the one with the fireplace), where the daily specials are marked on a blackboard. A real gem of restaurant, which also has a few charming guestrooms furnished in fir and cherry wood.
