1800	uovodiseppia Milano	via Amerigo Vespucci 11	Milan	20124	Italy	€€€	Mediterranean Cuisine, Sicilian	This completely renovated restaurant is situated in a pedestrianised area near Piazza Gae Aulenti, a new elegant restaurant district in Milan. Here, a wood-fired stove, attractive bar counter and small bistro-style tables provide the setting for carefully prepared Sicilian cuisine. Octopus, grouper and Mazara red prawns are just some of the top-quality Sicilian ingredients on the menu here, which includes reinterpreted recipes such as the “fuori Norma”, where the pasta is wrapped around the stuffed aubergine to create a dish full of Mediterranean flavours and aromas. The outdoor dining space in the pedestrianised street is perfect for early summer evenings, with its almost bohemian feel.
