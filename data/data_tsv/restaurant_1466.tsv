1466	ConTatto	via Gioberti 11	Frascati	00044	Italy	€€	Cuisine from Lazio	Situated in a small town just a few kilometres from the capital, this restaurant run by two young food enthusiasts serves regional dishes with a modern touch, such as cuttlefish with asparagus and a Bernese sauce. Guests can visit the interesting tufa-rock cellar, where the chef experiments with old preserving techniques and special flavourings. In addition, the cellar is used as a venue for exhibitions by different art galleries every season.
