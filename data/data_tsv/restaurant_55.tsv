55	Kitchen	via per Cernobbio 41/a	Como	22100	Italy	€€€	Italian Contemporary	Nestled amid the greenery of a private park, Kitchen is an elegant restaurant which serves creative Italian cuisine with a focus on seasonal ingredients and a perfect balance between produce, technique and flavour. The chef uses herbs and vegetables from the restaurant’s own biodynamic kitchen garden which can be seen in front of the entrance. This natural bounty provides the basis for the Green tasting menu; the other tasting menu is called Experience; there’s also an excellent à la carte. Service is attentive plus there’s an excellent selection of wines.
