1325	Il Narciso	viale Amerigo Vespucci 32	Carrara	54033	Italy	€€€	Italian Contemporary	Housed in the Polda baths near the marina, this recently opened small restaurant on the beach serves cuisine with a contemporary yet classic flavour. The restaurant boasts excellent bread, home-made pasta, traditionally cooked dishes such as chicken casserole and creative desserts. Highly recommended, especially the terrace with its fine sea views.
