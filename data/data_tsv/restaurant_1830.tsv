1830	I Pupi	via del Cavaliere 59	 Bagheria	 90011	 Italy	€€€€	Sicilian, Contemporary	Situated amid the streets of the old town, this restaurant boasts an intimate dining room and a pleasant outdoor space with a corner where guests can watch the appetisers being prepared. Chef Tony Lo Coco showcases Sicilian flavours and ingredients (meat and fish alike) which he transforms into personalised and imaginative dishes. His recipes often reinterpret great Sicilian classics, as is the case with his swordfish involtini where the traditional whipped filling is replaced by a cream on which the fish is placed and surrounded by ginger foam, or the famous cassata which he transforms into a transparent bubble in which all the different ingredients are then arranged. Elegant and professional service adds to the enjoyment of the experience.
