934	Motelombroso	Alzaia Naviglio Pavese 256	 Milan	 20142	 Italy	€€€	Modern Cuisine, Creative	An old, carefully restored road worker’s house on the Alzaia Naviglio Pavese canal is the setting for this modern, stylish restaurant where Alessandra and Matteo welcome guests in a graceful, elegant and yet informal manner. The menu features contemporary meat and fish dishes accompanied by a good choice of wines. If you’re curious about the restaurant’s name, ask the owners for an explanation: could it be something to do with the private dining room perhaps?
