69	Derby Grill	viale Cesare Battisti 1	Monza	20900	Italy	€€€	Italian Contemporary	Situated opposite the Villa Reale, this restaurant has the same classic, vaguely British ambience as the Hotel de la Ville in which it is situated, with tables also laid out on its elegant adjoining veranda. The menu features carefully prepared creative meat and fish dishes as well as traditional specialities from Lombardy, including risotto with Monza luganega sausage, ossobuco with gremolata parsley sauce and saffron rice, and an excellent costoletta alla Milanese (breaded veal).
