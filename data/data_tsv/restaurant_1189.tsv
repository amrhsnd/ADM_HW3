1189	Guido	lungomare Guido Spadazzi 12	 Rimini	 47924	 Italy	€€€	Seafood, Modern Cuisine	Although from the outside this looks like a simple private beach club with views of the sea in the distance, the interior reveals an unexpected and hushed elegance. Guests flock to Guido’s for its excellent fish and seafood: the dishes sound simple on the menu, yet are actually refined, elegant and beautifully prepared, celebrating the Adriatic in all its glory, with a focus on top-quality fish dishes. The menu features long-established classics (“canocchia si ricorda il gratin”) alongside new dishes such as the pizza ai frutti di mare which are themselves destined to become staples here. There’s a good choice of sparkling wines, as well as a focus on excellent whites and renowned reds.
