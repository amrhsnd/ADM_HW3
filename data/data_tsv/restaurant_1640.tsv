1640	Zanze XVI	fondamenta dei Tolentini, sestiere Santa Croce 231	Venice	30135	Italy	€€€€	Creative, Modern Cuisine	Although the setting and convivial atmosphere in this restaurant recall that of a typical Venetian bàcaro , the cuisine is completely different in feel. The ingredients are sourced from the best markets and local producers, resulting in unique dishes that reflect the culinary traditions of the lagoon and its surrounding area. The few tables arranged outdoors with views of the tranquil canal add to the appeal, while the professional yet friendly service helps to put guests completely at ease.
