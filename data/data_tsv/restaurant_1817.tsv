1817	Romanè	via Cipro 106	Rome	00136	Italy	€	Roman, Cuisine from Lazio	Situated close to the Vatican, this is one of the best trattorias in Rome, with simple decor and just one, usually very busy, dining room (booking ahead is recommended), as well as delicious cuisine from Lazio. Dishes include artichokes (both Roman- and Jewish-style), pasta with rich local sauces, offal specialities (“quinto quarto”), and delicious roast meats among the main courses. For dessert, we recommend the chocolate “tenerina” cake or the ricotta with sour cherries.
