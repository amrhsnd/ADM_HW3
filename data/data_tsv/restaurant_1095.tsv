1095	Osteria Platzegg	piazza Municipio 1	San Michele	39057	Italy	€€	Regional Cuisine, Classic Cuisine	This comfortable and informal “Gasthaus” with a simple yet welcoming and contemporary feel is run by talented chef Herbert Hintner, the undisputed master of Alto Adige cuisine. Housed within a historic building in the town’s pedestrianised centre, the restaurant serves simple cuisine with a focus on regional recipes and ingredients (such as potato ravioli filled with speck ham and spleen crostini in broth) alongside a few Mediterranean-influenced dishes such as arancini in a gorgonzola sauce. The wine list, on the other hand, focuses uniquely on the Alto Adige.
