1106	Cavallino	via Abetone Inferiore 1	Maranello	41053	Italy	€€	Emilian, Contemporary	Il Cavallino, a long-established restaurant which pays tribute to Ferrari – a symbol of Maranello and Italy across the globe – now has the added attraction of Massimo Bottura’s creative cuisine. Traditional regional dishes, such as the delicious tortellini del Tortellante, are given interesting, personalised twists, as evidenced by the crème caramel made with 36-month-aged Parmesan cheese, chives and 12-year-old balsamic vinegar. Trendy decor, plus a flower-decked garden.	['Amex', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	['Air conditioning', 'Terrace', 'Wheelchair access']	+39 0536 944877	http://www.ristorantecavallino.com
