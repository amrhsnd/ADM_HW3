Enjoy excellent service as you embark on a gastronomic journey that introduces you to specialities from chef Domingo Schingaro’s Puglia, dishes inspired by the region, and recipes influenced by the wider Mediterranean (depending on the menu). Many of the ingredients are sourced from the hotel’s own kitchen garden.
