1471	Le Colonne	viale Giulio Douhet 7/9	Caserta	81100	Italy	€€€	Campanian, Creative	You’d recognise this cuisine as southern Italian even if you were blindfolded, thanks to its strong and intense flavours. Imaginatively prepared and presented dishes, many of which showcase the region’s mozzarella cheese, plus a delicious selection of desserts and pastries. All in all, an excellent choice!
