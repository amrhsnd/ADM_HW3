1481	Antica Filanda	SS 157, contrada Raviola	Capri Leone	98070	Italy	€	Sicilian, Modern Cuisine	Although the view from this restaurant takes in the sea and the mountains alike, it’s the latter that inspires the menu. It features inland specialities cooked with the best local ingredients. Suckling pig is a particular favourite, appearing in a number of different guises, including cured ham and meat sauces. The restaurant also offers new, welcoming guestrooms.
