103	All’Ombra del Gabbiano	via Caneve 2	Mestre	30173	Italy	€€	Italian Contemporary, Vegan	This friendly Mediterranean-style bistro started out 20 years ago as an inn-cum- -cicchetteria (a type of Venetian tapas bar). It now offers 100% gluten-free recipes, including a few vegan options, without compromising in any way on the quality or beautiful presentation of the dishes featured on its well-constructed menu. Friendly, attentive service and summer outdoor dining in the pedestrianised area add to the appeal.
