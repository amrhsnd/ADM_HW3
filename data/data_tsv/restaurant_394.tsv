394	La Braja	via San Giovanni Bosco 11	Montemagno	14030	Italy	€€€	Piedmontese, Traditional Cuisine	A traditional Piedmontese restaurant, where owner Giuseppe Palermino welcomes guests to his elegant dining room with his consummate style. The specialities here have a regional focus with the occasional influence from further afield. The “tajarin al ristretto di coniglio” (shredded rabbit pasta) and the superb cheese trolley are particularly recommended.
