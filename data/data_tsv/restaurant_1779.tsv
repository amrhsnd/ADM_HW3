1779	Trattoria contemporanea	via del Ronco 10	Lomazzo	22074	Italy	€€€	Italian Contemporary, Creative	A young crew led by the talented chef Davide Marzullo surprises with their technique and cuisine of modern conception, where the dishes are ambassadors of both national and international flavors and combinations; the lamb, cumin, carrot and peanuts is excellent, a delicious skewer you can even eat with your fingers. Lunch is lighter, though you can also enjoy à la carte specialties and the three tasting menus with 4-7 courses. The industrial redevelopment of a former cotton factory provides a fine framework for all this energy.
