744	Da Marchesi	Località Ca' Gianessi 7	 Novafeltria	 47863	 Italy	€	Country cooking	Situated on a road that climbs through the Apennines between Romagna and the Marche, this small restaurant serves good, simple and traditional Romagna cuisine. The menu features home-made pasta and local meat dishes, as well as daily specials which focus on seasonal ingredients (don’t miss the “fossa” cheese from Perticara and the tortelloni with melted butter and truffles). One of our inspectors’ favourite trattorias!	['Dinersclub', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	['Car park', 'Terrace']	+39 0541 920148	https://www.damarchesi.com/
