1758	Radici Gourmet	via Andrea Costa 18/a	Padua	35124	Italy	€€€	Contemporary	Housed in a charming small villa dating from the early 20C, this multifunctional space combines an informal bar-cum-bistro with a gourmet restaurant where the chef delights guests with his interpretation of local cuisine, as implied by the name of the restaurant (“radici” is the Italian for roots). Two tasting menus, plus an extensive à la carte which offers something for all tastes. Professional service and personalised wine recommendations complete the picture.
