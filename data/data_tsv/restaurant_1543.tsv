1543	Ai Do Campanili	via Marco Polo 2	 Cavallino	 30013	 Italy	€€€	Seafood	Both the building in which it is housed and the dining room of this restaurant are on the small side, but the quality of the food more than compensates for the lack of space. Run by young and enthusiastic staff, the restaurant specialises in fish and seafood with raw options and modern dishes featuring on the menu. Excellent selection of wine, also available to take away.
