1791	Granoturco Bistrot	via Cavour 1	 Castagnole Piemonte	 10060	 Italy	€€	Piedmontese	Although the external façade of this restaurant recalls its former life as a pub, the building is now home to a restaurant run by a young chef whose experience working abroad has done nothing to dim his love of the Piedmont. Here, he serves some of the best regional cuisine in the area, with a few more creative options also featuring on the menu.
