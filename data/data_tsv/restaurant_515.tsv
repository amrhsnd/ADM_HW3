515	Serendib	via Pontida 2	Milan	20121	Italy	€	Indian, Asian	Serendib, the old name for Sri Lanka, means “to make happy” – an ambitious promise but one which this welcoming restaurant serving typical Indian and Sri Lankan dishes manages to keep. The tasting menu introduces guests to different specialities and comes highly recommended (especially if it’s your first time here).
