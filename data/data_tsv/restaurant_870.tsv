870	Il Basilisco	via Bison 34	Treviso	31100	Italy	€€	Classic Cuisine	Situated in a residential district on the outskirts of town, this simple restaurant with a colourful decor serves excellent cuisine. Although many of the dishes are typical Italian favourites, it is the local specialities, such as the sopa coada di piccione (a type of warm pigeon soup), that particularly won us over. The menu also features a few fish options.	['Amex', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	['Air conditioning', 'Car park', 'Terrace']	+39 0422 541822	https://www.ristorantebasilisco.com/
