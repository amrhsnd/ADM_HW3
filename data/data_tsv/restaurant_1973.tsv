1973	Peperosa	piazza dell'Anfiteatro 4	 Lucca	 55100	 Italy	€€	Modern Cuisine, Tuscan	Despite its idyllic location facing the picturesque Piazza dell'Anfiteatro, this restaurant has avoided becoming a tourist trap, evolving instead into one of the most interesting restaurants in Lucca. The menu is finely balanced between meat and fish dishes with more than just a hint of added creativity, plus there’s now a new chef at the helm.
