1317	Quadri Bistrot	Via Solferino 48	 Milan	 20121	 Italy	€€	Modern Cuisine, Contemporary	A modern bistro with a cocktail-bar, trendy decor, soft lighting and lounge-style background music, as well as a small outdoor space on the pavement which needs to be booked well in advance. The imaginative cuisine comes courtesy of a talented chef who creates dishes full of character from top-quality seasonal ingredients. Our inspectors particularly enjoyed the Bresse chicken stuffed with a cherry sauce.
