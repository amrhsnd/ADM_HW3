1278	Mirabelle	via di Porta Pinciana 14	Rome	00187	Italy	€€€€	Italian Contemporary	Without a shadow of a doubt, the view of Rome from this restaurant situated on the penultimate floor of the Splendide Royalhotel has few equals: from Villa Medici to Trinità dei Monti, and St Peter’s to the Gianicolo, the only way to enjoy a better view is to head up a floor to the hotel’s new Adèle lounge bar for an aperitif or after-dinner drink. Excellent service (especially in the evening) and modern yet traditionally influenced cuisine make this one of Rome’s best fine-dining restaurants.
